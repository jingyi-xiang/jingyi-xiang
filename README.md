# :wrench: About Me

I am an undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (graduating in May 2024). Since January 2022, I have been assisting a robotic caretaking project led by Ph.D. candidate [Holly Dinkel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hollymdinkel/) from the [Bretl Research Group](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/). My current research focuses on the perception and tracking of deformable linear objects (e.g. ropes and cables) for robotic manipulation applications.

Prior to that, I was a competition team lead for [Illini VEX Robotics](https://illinivex.web.illinois.edu/).
