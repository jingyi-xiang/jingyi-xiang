# :wrench: About Me

I am a first-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I am part of the RoboTouch Lab led by Professor [Wenzhen Yuan](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yuanwz). My research interests lie in the fields of tactile sensing and robotic manipulation. Outside of research, I spend my spare time taking photos, creating digital art, and playing video games.

Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. in electrical engineering at UIUC. During my undergrad, I was a research assistant at the UIUC [Bretl Research Group](https://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/) and a competition team lead for [Illini VEX Robotics](https://illinivex.web.illinois.edu/).
