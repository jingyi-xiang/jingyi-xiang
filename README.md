# :wrench: About Me

I am a second-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I am part of the [RoboTouch Lab](https://robotouchlab.web.illinois.edu/) led by Professor [Wenzhen Yuan](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yuanwz). My research interests include tactile sensing and robotic manipulation.

Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. in electrical engineering at UIUC. During my undergrad, I was a research assistant at the UIUC [Bretl Research Group](https://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/) and a competition team lead for Illini VEX Robotics.
