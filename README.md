# ðŸ’¬ About Me

I am an undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (expected to graduate in May 2024). I am also a team lead of UIUC's VEXU competition team and an undergraduate researcher working with the Bretl Research Group. My current research focuses on perception and tracking of deformable linear objects (e.g. ropes and cables).
